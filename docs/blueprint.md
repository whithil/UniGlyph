## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: `#338CFF` (a clear, digital blue, reflecting precision and functionality). Chosen for its calming yet professional appearance, contrasting well with a light background to highlight interactive elements.
- Background color: `#E9F0F6` (a very light, desaturated blue). This nearly-white shade provides a clean, unobtrusive canvas that aids readability, derived from the primary hue to maintain visual harmony.
- Accent color: `#4DCFE8` (a vibrant cyan-blue). This analogous hue offers a refreshing contrast, ideal for drawing attention to critical actions like copying, providing a clear visual cue without clashing.
- All text and headlines will use 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font. Its modern, machined, and objective appearance ensures high legibility and aligns with the app's technical precision, suitable for both short and longer text segments.
- Use minimalist, outline-style icons to maintain a clean and uncluttered interface, especially for actions like copying.
- A clean, two-column layout with clear distinction between input and output text areas, ensuring a straightforward user flow and focus on the character transformation.
- Subtle animation for button presses, providing instant feedback without distracting from the core functionality.
